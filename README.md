## What is Sweet Slots?
Legend has it that the first slot machine originated in 1894's San Francisco. An early version of the slot machine displayed fruits on the reels, each representing a different flavour of gum that would be dispensed by the win, giving rise to the name "Fruit machine". 

Although most machines are fully digital nowadays, many still include traditional elements such as a lever handle to pull or spinning slot visuals. Sweet Slots uses these elements combined with a retro-modern pixel art style to create a familiar yet novel experience. 

To play, one must:
1. Select an amount of money to bet
2. Click and pull the lever
3. If any listed combinations line up horizontally, the player wins!
